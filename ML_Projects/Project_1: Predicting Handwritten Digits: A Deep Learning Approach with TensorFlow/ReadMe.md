## Report on MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification using TensorFlow

**Introduction:**

In this report, we'll explore a basic implementation of a neural network model using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This report is tailored for beginners and aims to explain each step in a clear and understandable manner.

1. Loading and Understanding the Data:

We begin by loading the MNIST dataset, which is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, each containing images and their corresponding labels (the digit they represent).
2. Data Preprocessing:

Before feeding the data into our neural network, we normalize the pixel values. This means scaling them down to a range between 0 and 1, which helps the model to converge faster during training.
3. Building the Neural Network Model:

We construct a simple neural network model using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
This model consists of:
Flatten Layer: Reshapes the 2D array of pixel values into a 1D array. This is necessary to feed the data into the next layers.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers that perform mathematical operations on the input data.
The first dense layer has 128 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function, which introduces non-linearity into the model.
The second dense layer has 10 neurons (since we have 10 possible output classes) and uses the softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.
4. Compiling the Model:

We compile the model using the 'adam' optimizer and the 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' loss function.
Additionally, we specify 'accuracy' as a metric to monitor during training.
5. Training the Model:

We train the model using the training images and labels for a predefined number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset).
During training, the model learns to make predictions by adjusting its internal parameters (weights) based on the provided data.
6. Evaluating the Model:

After training, we evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset to assess how well it generalizes to unseen data.
We compute the test loss and accuracy to measure the model's effectiveness in classifying handwritten digits.
7. Saving and Loading the Model:

Finally, we save the trained model to disk using the 'save' method.
Later, we load the saved model back into memory using the 'load_model' function to make predictions or further training without retraining from scratch.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, this report outlines the process of building, training, evaluating, saving, and loading a basic neural network model for handwritten digit classification using TensorFlow. By following these steps, we can create models capable of recognizing handwritten digits with reasonable accuracy. This serves as a foundation for more advanced deep learning applications and provides a hands-on introduction to machine learning concepts for beginners.

This report aims to provide a clear understanding of each step involved in the process, making it accessible to individuals with little to no prior knowledge of deep learning or programming.
